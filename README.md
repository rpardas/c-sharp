C Sharp projects

## MagicDestroyers
This project was developed while taking a C# course on Udemy. It is a console game application that randomly generates battles between members of 'Melee' and 'Spellcasters' teams.
The primary purpose was to learn the building blocks of a C# project - Classes, Fields, Properties, Methods, Constructors, Interfaces, Enumerations.
